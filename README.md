- **Fundamentals**
  - Introduction to Supervised Learning  
  - Train-Test Split & Cross Validation  
  - Performance Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)  

- **Regression**
  - Linear Regression  
  - Polynomial Regression  
  - Regularization (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet)  

- **Classification**
  - Logistic Regression  
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
